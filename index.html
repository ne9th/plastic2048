        <h3><span style="color:#D05A57">Plastic</span>2048</h3>
        <p>Our oceans and marine life are choking on plastic. According to <a href="https://plasticoceans.org/the-facts/" target="_blank">Plastic Oceans,</a> more than 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans every year.
          Studies have shown that 50% of sea turtles worldwide have consumed plastic. Many seabirds were also found dead with their stomachs full of plastic waste.</p>
        <p>There are many ways that plastics can enter our oceans. This game only shows one of them: how plastic bags travel from our homes to the ocean. Oher ways that put many marine lives at risk include plastic litter, the use of
          products that contain microbeads (tiny balls of plastic), and industrial leakage.
        </p>
        <p>Though, many of us are fully aware of the negative effects of plastic, we don't always think about it when we make our everyday decisions. And that is the main motivation for this project––to help draw that
          connection between our actions and their impacts so we can learn to be more consious about the world around us.

      <h4> =<span class="spacing">4</span></h4>
      <h5>Sometimes, we need multiple bags.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/trash_bin.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">8</span></h4>
      <h5>Then, we throw our plastic bags in the trash because we can't put them in the recycling bin.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/garbage_truck.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">16</span></h4>
      <h5>A garbage truck would come to collect the trash.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/landfill.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">32</span></h4>
      <h5>The trash will then be dumped in a landfill.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/plastic_flying.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">64</span></h4>
      <h5>However, even when it's in landfills, it can easily be carried away by wind and rain due to its light weight.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/plastic_in_river.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">128</span></h4>
      <h5>They can, then, end up in our drainage networks or rivers.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/plastic_in_ocean.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">256</span></h4>
      <h5>Eventually, they will flow into t\our oceans.</h5>

      <h4> =<span class="spacing">512</span></h4>
      <h5>Once they are in the ocean, these plastic items can trap marine life. They can be extremely harmful to big animals and lethal to smaller ones.</h5>

      <img src="images/212/plastic_p2.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">1024</span></h4>
      <h5>Plastic comsuption is one of the most life-threatening issues for marine animals. The plastic would take up space in their stomach, making them think that they are full. But since they don't actually receive any nutrients, this could lead to starvation and death.</h5>


      <img src="images/212/plastic_p3.jpg" width ="200">
      <h4> =<span class="spacing">2048</span></h4>
      <h5>Lastly, not only do plastic pollution affect life in water, it affects life on land as well. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/09/24/plastic-pollution-affects-sea-life-throughout-the-ocean">PEW</a>, "plastic waste kills up to a million seabirds a year." This is a striking number and sadly, it won't be decreasing any time soon without our combined effort.</h5>
